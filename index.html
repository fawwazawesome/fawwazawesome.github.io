			<h2> Summary </h2>


		</p>

		<p> An unprecedented cinematic journey ten years in the making and spanning the entire <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios' "Avengers: Infinity War" 
		</strong>brings to the screen the ultimate, deadliest showdown of all time. The Avengers and their Super Hero allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.</p>


		<p>Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.

		Having acquired the Power Stone from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept a spaceship carrying the last survivors of Asgard. As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.

		<p><h3> Critics Review </h3></p>


		<p> 1. Never has the "Marvel Cinematic Universe" 		seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War-the title is almost too apt-is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been.
		</p>

		<p> 2.
			The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
		</p>

		<p> 3. 
			Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early. 
		</p>

		<p>4.
			Despite the crowding and the abundance of story, the Russos offered up something that was relatively easy to follow, because all of the various strands of the story laid out over the last ten years were tossed aside for a simple and basic plot.

			<em> Infinity War marks the first time that Scotland has been featured as a location in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Speaking with Rosie Ellison, Film Commissioner at Film Edinburgh, she explains: “the filmmakers were looking for something unique, gothic and dramatic and Edinburgh’s Old Town with its medieval architecture fitted the bill. They were also looking for something they hadn’t seen in blockbusters of this scale and while the city is accustomed to filming, with over 350 productions a year, including most recently films like T2 Trainspotting, Avengers: Infinity War is the first production of this huge scale and truly global reach to choose Edinburgh, so it was a very exciting prospect and one that I’m pleased to say the city embraced wholeheartedly.”</em>
